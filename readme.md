MongoStats
==========

MongoStats is a convenience library created to provide fast programmatic
access to operational stats for MongoDB servers and databases.

MongoStats was inspired by John Nunemaker's Scout MongoDB plugin.

All things considered, the use of MongoStats should make pushing
statistics to your graphing/logging/metric system pretty easy.
